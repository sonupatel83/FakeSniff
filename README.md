# FakeSniff  - Open Source DeepFake Detection

FakeSniff is a Streamlit-based web application for DeepFake detection, offering an easy-to-use interface for analyzing images and videos. Users can add their own deepfake detection models and compare them with existing models out of the box.

## WebApp

## Features

‚ú® **Multi-model Support**: Users can select from multiple DeepFake detection models for both images and videos.  
üìÅ **File Upload**: Supports uploading images (jpg, png, jpeg) and videos (mp4, mov).  
üåê **URL Input**: Allows users to input URLs for image or video analysis.  
‚öôÔ∏è **Processing Unit Selection**: Option to use GPU for supported models (default is CPU).  
üìä **Result Visualization**: 
- 1.Displays DeepFake detection stats in a table format.
- 2.Provides downloadable CSV of detection results.
- 3.Visualizes results with bar charts for DeepFake probability and inference time.

## Usage

1. Select the "Detector" option from the sidebar.
2. Upload an image/video or provide a URL.
3. Choose the DeepFake detection model(s) you want to use.
4. Optionally select GPU processing if available.
5. Click "Real or Fake? ü§î" to start the analysis.
6. View the results in the displayed charts and tables.

## Installation

1. Create a conda environment:
